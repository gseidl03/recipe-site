            <li>Mince 1 large onion, 2 medium carrots (peeled), and 3 ribs of celery.</li><br>
            <li>In a large pot, brown your beef, pork and lamb (if included) in olive oil over medium heat for 3-5 minutes.
                Move to seperate bowl.</li><br>
            <li>In a seperate pan, brown 1/2 pound of pancetta until fat is rendered out and meat is cripsy.</li><br>
            <li>In the same large pot, saute the onions with the finely chopped celery and carrots until soft.</li><br>
            <li>Once the vegetables and pancetta are done, mix together along with 1/4 cup of tomato paste.</li><br>
            <li>After 2 minutes, mix in 1 cup of white wine and use to deglaze. Let simmer until the wine is almost fully evaporated.</li><br>
            <li>Add back in your browned meats and stir together. Once mixed, add in enough chicken stock to just cover everything.</li><br>
            <li>Mix in 1 cup of whole milk, 1 bay leaf (or 2), a couple of parmesan cheese rinds (optional), and grated nutmeg</li><br>
            <li>Place into a 300Â°F oven for 3-4 hours.</li><br>
            <li>Once the sauce is out of the oven and pasta is finished, skim off any excess fat from the sauce and remove the bay 
                leaf from the pot. Taste for seasoning.</li><br>
            <li>Mix in parmesean, 1/2 cup of heavy cream (optional), kosher salt, and black pepper to taste.</li><br>
            <li>Into a saucepan, place a generous amount of sauce and mix with cooked pasta and ~1/4 cup of pasta water.</li><br>
            <li>Place onto a plate (or bowl) for serving.</li>
